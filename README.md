# Focus Timer

This project was developed in React with the objective of consolidating my knowledge in this library. Some tools were used, like Styled Components, React hook form, Zod, React Router Dom, Context API and some React hooks, like useReducer... and more.

Focus Timer was developed inspired by the Pomodoro concept, in which you determine a time to stay focused on work or study and then a rest time with one or more cycles. It will be completely personalized, being able to put the name of the task, the focus time, the rest time and the number of cycles. It is possible to see the history of the tasks that the user has already done, if the tasks were completed, if they were interrupted or if it is in progress.
